            <p>
                amoreywebdesign is the studio of artist alice morey. 
                <br><br>
                Born from a desire to merge the tactile, experimental nature of artistic practice with the logic and structure of the web, this project is not just a pivot—it's a creative expansion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rooted in my experience as a contemporary artist, this studio is an extension of how I engage 
                with the world: through experimentation, autonomy, and craft. 
                <br><br>
                amoreywebdesign creates clean, 
                beautiful, and functional websites for creatives, institutions, and small businesses—without 
                bloated tech or a corporate edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn’t about reinventing the wheel, but about approaching web design as a 
                new artistic medium—websites as small artworks, made with care, for humans, not algorithms. 
                The idea emerged during a time of uncertainty: navigating career shifts, job markets, and 
                self-doubt. And in that space, I realised: I could build something of my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I’m building sites from scratch, learning frameworks, integrating tools 
                like Stripe, and embracing code as part of my practice. 
                This is a brand made from experience, from limitations turned into strengths, 
                and a desire to help others have a home online that feels personal, accessible, 
                and thoughtfully built.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're someone who values intention, transparency, and design with a soul—this is for you.
