            <h2>CONCEPT</h2>
            <p>
                ** amoreywebdesign is the web design studio of artist alice morey. 
                <br><br> 
                ** born from a desire to merge the tactile, experimental nature of artistic practice with the logic and structure of the web, this project is not just a pivot—it's a creative expansion.
            </p>
            <p>
                ** rooted in my experience as a contemporary artist, this studio is an extension of how I engage 
                with the world: through experimentation, autonomy, and craft. 
                <br><br>
                ** amoreywebdesign creates clean, 
                beautiful, and functional websites for creatives, institutions, and small businesses—without 
                bloated tech or a corporate edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                ** this isn’t about reinventing things, but about approaching web design as a 
                new artistic medium—websites as small artworks, made with care, for humans, not algorithms. 
                The idea emerged during a time of uncertainty: navigating career shifts, job markets, and 
                self-doubt. And in that space, I realised: I could build something of my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                ** now I’m building sites from scratch, learning frameworks, integrating tools 
                like stripe, and embracing code as part of my practice. 
                this is a brand made from a developing experience, from limitations turned into strengths, 
                and a desire to help others have a home online that feels personal, accessible, 
                and thoughtfully built.
            </p>
